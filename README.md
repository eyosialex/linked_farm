The Farmer’s Suite (Primary Actor)
Farmers are categorized by their water source (Rain-feed, Irrigation, or Mixed) and crop focus (Fruits vs. Cereals).

Virtual Farming & Prediction Page (AgriLead):
A highly advanced "Digital Twin" of the farmer's plot. It uses 5–10 day weather forecasts, soil data (pH, precipitation, nutrient levels), and AI to predict the ideal planting dates and provide daily "best-practice" reminders.
Learning Hub (Agricultural Academy):
Provides Free and Premium courses. Pages include video lessons on land preparation, fertilizer application, pest management (Pest/Herb/Fungal), and winter business strategies.
AI & Expert Advisor Portal:
Allows farmers to chat with professional human experts (PhD/Masters holders) or the AI Advisor. A "Camera Feature" allows farmers to snap photos of crop infections for instant identification and chemical (pesticide/herbicide) recommendations.
Marketplace (Buy/Sell):
A direct-to-buyer page where farmers list products (Teff, Wheat, Coffee, etc.) for industries, hotels, or exporters. They can also buy inputs like high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and even new land.
Land Management & Clustering Page:
A specialized interface for Land Allocation. It allows small-scale farmers to "cluster" their lands digitally to work as a unified block, attracting tractors, combine harvesters, and investors through shared rules and resources.
2. The Vendor’s Suite
Designed for hotels, juice houses, food complexes, and exporters to source raw materials efficiently.

Market Explorer & Cart:
Vendors can browse categorized farm products (e.g., Akaki Onions, Koye Potatoes), add them to their cart, and pay via integrated payment gateways.
Order Management & Notification Hub:
A "Wanted Product" page where vendors post their needs. The app automatically notifies them the moment a farmer lists a matching product.
Price Prediction Hub:
Displays advanced analytical graphs. If the price of 1 quintal of Wheat is 7,000 ETB today but predicted to be 9,000 ETB next week, the vendor receives a "Buy Now" alert.
Trusted Farmer Index:
An AI-driven recommendation system that highlights farmers with high ratings and consistent supply records to ensure quality for new vendors.
3. The Deliverer’s Suite
The bridge between remote rural farms and urban town centers.

Delivery Dashboard:
Shows available "Sell Items" nearby. Deliverers can negotiate prices directly with vendors through the app.
Live Tracking & Logistics Page:
Once an agreement is made, the deliverer’s location is live-tracked. The vendor sees a real-time map of their cargo.
Smart Routing:
Integrates road peace and traffic situational data to provide the fastest route from farm to gate.
4. The Shopper (Agri-Input Supplier) Suite
For businesses selling pesticides, tools, and fertilizers.

Inventory & Standards Page:
Allows suppliers to list inputs with expiry dates. The system strictly prohibits "fake" or expired products.
Smart Referral System:
When the AI Advisor or a Human Expert recommends a specific pesticide to a farmer, the app automatically sends a "Direct Link" to the nearest Shopper who has that item in stock.
5. Specialized Roles (Researcher, Credit, Investor)
Researcher Portal:
Allows authorized researchers to access anonymized farm data to build better climate and yield models that are then fed back into the app for farmer benefit.
Credit & Financial Service Hub:
Banks and micro-finances use this page to assess a farmer's creditworthiness based on Crop Prediction Models. If the app predicts a high-yield harvest, the farmer’s risk rating decreases, making it easier to get low-interest loans.
Investor Matchmaking:
Investors can view "Clustered Lands" or "Half-Half Farming" opportunities, allowing them to fund large-scale modern farming projects directly.
6. Government & Bureau Integration
The app serves as a digital extension of the Ethiopian Agriculture Bureau:

Agricultural Centers & Colleges: A direct channel for government extension workers to push official protocols and for students to perform fieldwork data collection.
Tax & Resource Management: Integrated pages for structured tax reporting and centralized fertilizer/irrigation resource distribution tracking.
